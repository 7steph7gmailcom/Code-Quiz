# Code Quiz

## Stephanie Johansson

Code Quiz - This project was to create a quiz about any subject matter you wish.
The user should be able to start the quiz by pushing a button that starts a time clock. Then a series of questions should be presented allowing the user to answer each question. Every question that is answered incorrectly will take off 10 seconds to their quiz time. At the end of the quiz the correct number of answers should populate and the user then prompted with a space is sign their initials to record their score. Local storage should keep track of the high scores of the game for the user.
